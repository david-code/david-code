# Hello!

My name is David:

- I'm a software engineer with a background in fullstack web development. On the backend, I've worked with Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask) and Java (Spring Boot). My frontend experience includes various frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue), with a preference for Typescript.
- Right now I'm learning Rust and networking fundamentals. If that sort of thing interests you, check out [i-see-tcp](https://git.sr.ht/~davidcode/i-see-tcp), where I'm working on visualizing certain aspects pf TCP.
- Always interested in learning more about geospatial programming, databases, and the Fediverse.
